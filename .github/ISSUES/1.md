To keep the examples in this repo as simple as possible, they assume you have a [default VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html) in your AWS account. The error above most likely means you don't have a default VPC, which typically means someone deleted it. You can [contact AWS support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/deleted-default-vpc/) to ask them to put it back.

You could also add Terraform code to create a custom VPC, but it's a fair amount of code (subnets, route tables, gateways, etc) that is more complicated than necessary for the simple examples in this repo.
