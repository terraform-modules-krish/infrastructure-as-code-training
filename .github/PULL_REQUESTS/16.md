# Update Packer template for new Packer Versions

**dmattia** commented *Jun 2, 2020*

This PR does two things:
1) Adds an alternative option to the JSON packer template with a near-equivalent HCL template
2) Updates the JSON template to work with newer Packer versions

HCL support for Packer is currently in beta, but the advantages of having a language like HCL as opposed to JSON were enough that we use HCL when possible at Transcend.

This PR is purely optional, and if you'd like I can leave the code until HCL is more officially supported just in my fork as a reference for our employees.

Let me know what you think!

# EDIT 1:

I removed the new HCL file, leaving just the JSON updates

Sounds great! I figured this was the most likely outcome.

I removed the HCL file and updated the PR title and description
