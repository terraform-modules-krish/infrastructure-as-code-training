**⚠️ Not a part of reviewing this PR, but still worth pointing out:**
It seems like we've got enabled CircleCI building for this project, but there's no `.circleci/config.yaml` configuration. I think we should either 1) add a circleci config to run some `tf validate` type of pipeline... we've got _some_ code after all; alternatively 2) disable the check for this repo from CircleCI [here](https://app.circleci.com/settings/project/github/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-as-code-training?return-to=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.circleci.com%2Fpipelines%2Fgithub%2Fgruntwork-io%2Finfrastructure-as-code-training%2F14%2Fworkflows%2Ff29271a2-9404-42d2-934b-7b97145ded1c%2Fjobs%2F14). We might need Jim's credentials here.
