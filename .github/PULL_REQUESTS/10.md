# Extend full example

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 15, 2019*

I made a few tweaks to the training video, which requires some tweaks to the code:

- I bumped the rails version used to `4.2.6`, which is what comes with the ubuntu AMI when you do `apt-get install rails`
- I added another module block to the terraform code to show deploying the same module twice using different parameters, which is what makes modules compelling.

Thanks for the review! I am going to go ahead and merge this since it is used in the course refresh.
