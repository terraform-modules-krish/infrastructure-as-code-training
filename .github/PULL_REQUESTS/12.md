# Fix gem versions to match ubuntu package updates

**yorinasub17** commented *Dec 17, 2019*

This fixes a packer build error in the `packer-example` caused by discrepancies between the Ubuntu package versions and the bundled `Gemfile`. We address it by locking the versions of various packages to ensure they match to avoid causing a native extension installation.
