<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/releases">rails-html-sanitizer's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>1.4.3 / 2022-06-09</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Address a possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of Rails::Html::Sanitizer.</p>
<p>Prevent the combination of <code>select</code> and <code>style</code> as allowed tags in SafeListSanitizer.</p>
<p>Fixes CVE-2022-32209</p>
<p><em>Mike Dalessio</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.4.2 / 2021-08-23</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Slightly improve performance.</p>
<p>Assuming elements are more common than comments, make one less method call per node.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.4.1 / 2021-08-18</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix regression in v1.4.0 that did not pass comment nodes to the scrubber.</p>
<p>Some scrubbers will want to override the default behavior and allow comments, but v1.4.0 only
passed through elements to the scrubber's <code>keep_node?</code> method.</p>
<p>This change once again allows the scrubber to make the decision on comment nodes, but still skips
other non-elements like processing instructions (see <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/issues/115">#115</a>).</p>

</ul>
<h2>1.4.0 / 2021-08-18</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Processing Instructions are no longer allowed by Rails::Html::PermitScrubber</p>
<p>Previously, a PI with a name (or &quot;target&quot;) matching an allowed tag name was not scrubbed. There
are no known security issues associated with these PIs, but similar to comments it's preferred to
omit these nodes when possible from sanitized output.</p>
