Updated to the new terraform version for the tags property from "tags {" to "tags = {"

I assume you're using Terraform 0.12 now? If so, we need to update this whole repo to use TF 0.12, which includes this tags change, but also quite a few other tweaks. I'm not sure we should do a partial upgrade...

Yes, beginning with Terraform so I'm using the latest version.
No problem to not update, I will wait for the entire update.

Thanks for your contribution! As @brikis98 mentioned, we need to update the whole codebase to HCL2. I went ahead and implemented this in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-as-code-training/pull/8, where all the code has been updated. Going to close this now.
